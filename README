Tiny CPU is a small 32-bit CPU done mostly as a hobby for educational purposes.
The primary goal is to be binary compatible with non-FPU MIPS32 architecture
First release should be binary compatible with MIPS I architecture which is a subset of MIPS32.

A few examples are using 8-bit wide registers and data-path.

Content : 

examples/pipeline : 3-stages pipeline implementation example, just a skeleton.
examples/memory-controller : simple SRAM memory-controller, acts like a Round-Robin scheduler for memory accesses.
examples/instruction-fetcher : a 1-stage pipeline featuring previous pipeline and memory-controller in order to fetch instructions from SRAM.
examples/instruction-decoder : a 2-stages pipeline featuring previous pipeline, memory-controller and instruction fetcher in order to fetch, decode and execute 32 bits MIPS I instructions.
The previous directory is a draft and a work in progress of a 32 bits MIPS I binary compatible softcore.
